                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p class=>
                    I'm a software developer who specializes in exploring complex problem domains and
                    creating tools to work within them. Sometimes, this means tools to ease software
                    development, and other times, this means tools that create new types of media (visual
                    art, music, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website serves as a reference for things I've built and for my works-in-progress
                    (there's always something). This page is a more generic and broad version of my resume.
                    If you'd like to see my formal resume, please
